# Secure Communication System

Welcome to the Secure Communication System project! This repository contains a secure communication platform built to facilitate encrypted messaging and file exchange between users. The project is designed with a strong focus on security principles and leverages Golang, Linux, and systemd to deliver a reliable and efficient system.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures all communication and file exchanges are secure and private. 
- **User Authentication**: Implements robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
- **File Transfer**: Supports encrypted file sharing between users.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with Linux systems in mind but adaptable to other environments.
- **Systemd Integration**: Provides seamless service management using systemd.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes Go's concurrency model for efficient communication handling.

## Objectives

1. Practice Golang programming and its standard library.
2. Implement core security principles, including encryption and authentication.
3. Integrate with Linux systemd for process management.
4. Build a reliable, secure communication platform.
5. Learn and apply networking concepts in a real-world project.
