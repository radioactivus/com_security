# Secure Communication System

Welcome to the Secure Communication System project! This repository contains a secure communication platform built to facilitate encrypted messaging and file exchange between users. The project is designed with a strong focus on security principles and leverages Golang, Linux, and systemd to deliver a reliable and efficient system.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures all communication and file exchanges are secure and private.
- **User Authentication**: Implements robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
- **File Transfer**: Supports encrypted file sharing between users.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with Linux systems in mind but adaptable to other environments.
- **Systemd Integration**: Provides seamless service management using systemd.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes Go's concurrency model for efficient communication handling.

## Objectives

1. Practice Golang programming and its standard library.
2. Implement core security principles, including encryption and authentication.
3. Integrate with Linux systemd for process management.
4. Build a reliable, secure communication platform.
5. Learn and apply networking concepts in a real-world project.

```

## Prerequisites

- **Golang**: Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.18 or higher.
- **Linux System**: A Linux distribution with systemd support.
- **Dependencies**: Install required dependencies via the `go mod` file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-communication-system.git
   cd secure-communication-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o secure_comm ./cmd/server
   ```

4. Set up systemd:
   - Copy the provided unit file to `/etc/systemd/system`.
   - Enable and start the service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable secure-comm.service
     sudo systemctl start secure-comm.service
     ```

5. Run the client:
   ```bash
   ./secure_comm
   ```

## Security Considerations

- **Encryption**: Uses modern cryptographic libraries for secure communication.
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and token-based systems are planned.
- **Audit Logging**: All critical events are logged for security auditing.
- **Least Privilege**: Services run with minimal permissions to enhance security.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a user-friendly CLI for communication.
- [ ] Add support for group chats and broadcasting.
- [ ] Enhance file transfer capabilities (e.g., resumable uploads).
- [ ] Implement MFA for user authentication.
- [ ] Develop a web interface for non-CLI users.
- [ ] Perform penetration testing and security audits.
