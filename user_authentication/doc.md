# User Authentication with x509 Certificates

This document outlines the user authentication approach using x509 certificates. The system employs a hierarchical structure with a root certificate authority (CA), multiple intermediate certificates, and end-user certificates. The primary goal is to ensure a secure and scalable authentication mechanism.

## Authentication Model

### **Root Certificate Authority (CA)**
- **Purpose**: The root CA is the trusted authority responsible for signing intermediate certificates.
- **Key Specifications**:
  - Algorithm: RSA 384-bit.
  - Validity: Long-term (e.g., 10+ years).
  - Storage: Kept offline to ensure security and prevent compromise.

### **Intermediate Certificates**
- **Purpose**: Issued by the root CA, intermediate certificates correspond to specific regions or countries and are used to sign end-user certificates.
- **Key Specifications**:
  - Algorithm: RSA 256-bit.
  - Validity: Medium-term (e.g., 3-5 years).
  - Scope: Each intermediate certificate represents a specific country or region.

### **End-User Certificates**
- **Purpose**: Assigned to individual users for authentication.
- **Key Specifications**:
  - Algorithm: RSA 256-bit.
  - Validity: Short-term (e.g., 1 year).
  - Usage: Authentication and digital signatures.

## Certificate Hierarchy

1. **Root CA**:
   - Signs intermediate certificates.
   - Acts as the ultimate trust anchor.

2. **Intermediate Certificates**:
   - Delegated to regions or countries.
   - Signs end-user certificates.

3. **End-User Certificates**:
   - Identifies individual users.
   - Used for authentication.

## Key Management

### **Root CA**
- Stored offline in a secure environment.
- Only brought online for signing intermediate certificates.

### **Intermediate Certificates**
- Stored on secure systems with limited access.
- Used for signing end-user certificates.

### **End-User Certificates**
- Distributed to individual users securely.
- Users must protect their private keys (e.g., using encrypted storage).

## Certificate Validation Process

1. **Chain Validation**:
   - Each certificate in the chain (end-user -> intermediate -> root) must be verified.
   - Ensures the chain of trust is intact.

2. **Revocation Checks**:
   - Uses CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) or OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) to validate certificate status.

3. **Usage Restrictions**:
   - Ensures certificates are used only for their intended purposes (e.g., client authentication).

## Security Considerations

- **Key Lengths**: RSA 384-bit for the root CA provides high security, while RSA 256-bit for intermediates and end-user certificates balances performance and security.
- **Certificate Policies**: Define the scope and usage of certificates clearly.
- **Revocation**: Maintain up-to-date CRLs or enable OCSP to ensure compromised certificates are invalidated promptly.
- **Secure Storage**: Protect private keys with strong encryption and restrict access to authorized personnel or systems.

## Advantages of this Approach

- **Scalability**: The intermediate CA model allows for delegation and better management of certificates across regions or countries.
- **Security**: Root CA is kept offline, reducing the risk of compromise.
- **Flexibility**: Different intermediate CAs can enforce specific policies based on regional requirements.
- **Trustworthiness**: x509 certificates are a well-established standard for secure authentication.
